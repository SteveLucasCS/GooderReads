## About
A parody Project by Shayne Officer, Ryan Brode-Frank, Steve Lucas, Nathan Walker, and Shawn Ard. 

GooderReads was conceived as a project to let us test our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and Relational Database Usage. 

The application opens with a landing page where users are shown a featured books of the day page. From this users are able to login and register to our site. The registration process allows users to select from over 25 Genres of Books. Once the User has registered and/or logged in they are able to rate and review books they have already read, as well as create a list of books they are interested in. The user profile page will feature suggestions catered to the user based on genres they have selected and books they have reviewed!
